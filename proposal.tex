\maketitle

\section{Motivation}

Computers and even mobile devices are increasingly shipping with multiple cores. Any modern
operating system must be able to take advantage of all available processors. While modern
operating systems support running on all cores, many use coarse-grained mutual exclusion 
within the kernel to protect its data structures from synchronization issues. With this
approach, no actual parallelism is achieved within kernel tasks. Applying lock-free and 
wait-free algorithms to the kernel would allow parallelism in an operating system's own
tasks.
